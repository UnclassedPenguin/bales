To-do:
  - Add an ability to get average. for square/round. maybe by group as well. for daily weekly monthly?
  - ~~Add check to date if entered to make sure it is actually a date and not some random string...Regex?~~
  - ~~Add ability to send custom sql command to list.~~
  - ~~Add flag to pull/push from git to update database~~
    - Finally got this figured out...
  - ~~Add ability to get entries from date range. Maybe separate by year/month. Individual or range. have to be year and month....~~
    - This is implemented somewhat, although probably done poorly. Not sure how to organize it...it works, but I'm sure there are lots of weird errors if you don't enter it how it expects. 
  - ~~Look into flag to see if you can add a description for -h. add more info to help~~
  - ~~Add ability to list only a specific group. i.e. bales -l -g bulls would query everything for just bulls~~
  - ~~Add ability to get a total count for all | square/round | specific group.~~
  - ~~Add ability to get total count for square or round bales~~
