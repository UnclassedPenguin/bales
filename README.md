To-do:
  - Add flag to pull/push from git to update database
  - Add ability to get entries from date range. Maybe separate by year/month. Individual or range. have to be year and month....
    - This is implemented somewhat, although probably done poorly. Not sure how to organize it...it works, but I'm sure there are lots of weird errors if you don't enter it how it expects. 
  - ~~Look into flag to see if you can add a description for -h. add more info to help~~
  - ~~Add ability to list only a specific group. i.e. bales -l -g bulls would query everything for just bulls~~
  - ~~Add ability to get a total count for all | square/round | specific group.~~
  - ~~Add ability to get total count for square or round bales~~
